 Using the prototype chain
Store the increment function in just one object and have the interpreter, if it
doesn't find the function on user1, look up to that object to check if it's there
Link user1 and functionStore so the interpreter, on not finding .increment, makes
sure to check up in functionStore where it would find it
Make the link with Object.create() technique
