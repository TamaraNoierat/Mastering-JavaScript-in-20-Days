### 1. Scope:

What it is: Scope defines where variables and functions are accessible in your code.
Imagine: Think of scope like different rooms in a house. Each room has its own things (variables/functions) that are only accessible in that room.
Example: If you declare a variable inside a function, you can only use it within that function.

### 2. Nested Scope:
What it is: Nested scope means having scopes inside other scopes, like rooms within rooms.
Imagine: It's like having smaller rooms inside bigger rooms. Things from the big room might not be easily accessible in the smaller rooms.
Example: If you have a function inside another function, the inner function can access its own variables and the variables of the outer function, but not the other way around.

### 3. Hoisting:
What it is: Hoisting moves declarations (not assignments) to the top of their scope during compilation.
Imagine: It's like reading a storybook. You know the main characters' names before you start reading about them in the story.
Example: You can use a variable before you declare it, but only if the declaration is hoisted to the top of the scope.


### 4. Closure:
What it is: A closure is when a function "remembers" its surrounding variables even after the function has finished running.
Imagine: Think of a lunchbox. It keeps your food safe and warm until you're ready to eat, even if you're far from the kitchen.
Example: A function inside another function can still access the variables of the outer function even after the outer function has completed.


### 5. Modules:
What it is: Modules let you organize your code into separate files and use only what you need in each part of your program.
Imagine: Imagine a toolbox with compartments. You only take out the tools you need for a specific task, keeping everything else organized.
Example: Instead of writing all your code in one big file, you can break it into smaller files (modules) for different parts of your application.
