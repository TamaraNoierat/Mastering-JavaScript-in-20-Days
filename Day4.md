A function is a block of code that can be executed when called (invoked).
Functions are used to perform specific tasks or calculations.
Functions can accept input values (parameters) and return an output value.


# Parameters:


Parameters are variables listed in the function's parentheses when defining it.
They act as placeholders for the values that the function will receive when it's called.
Parameters are like labels for values that a function needs to work with.

# Arguments:

Arguments are the actual values that are passed to a function when it's called.
They are the real data that correspond to the parameters in the function definition.
When you call a function, you provide arguments that match the order and number of parameters.

### Arrow functions are great when we just want to return a value

<img src="https://github.com/TamaraNoierat/Mastering-JavaScript-in-20-Days/assets/130704887/b350dc7e-abd4-4a65-836b-a337aa7d2c10" width="555">

An arrow function in JavaScript is a shorter way to write a function using the => syntax. It's great for concise functions and keeps the value of this consistent. Here's how it looks:

#### If we need to do more than just return a value,#### we can use curly braces for a "normal" function body
#### In that case, we still need a return.

Setting an attribute in JavaScript means adding or changing a specific attribute of an HTML element
```
<button id="myButton">Click me</button>
```

```
// Get a reference to the button element
const button = document.getElementById("myButton");

// Set the "disabled" attribute to true
button.setAttribute("disabled", true);

```

If you want to remove an attribute, you can use the removeAttribute function:
```
// Remove the "disabled" attribute
button.removeAttribute("disabled");

**************

The removeAttribute method in JavaScript is used to remove an attribute from an HTML element. Here's how it works:

Get the HTML element you want to remove the attribute from, using methods like document.getElementById().
Call the removeAttribute() method on the element and pass the name of the attribute you want to remove as an argument.

# scope
In JS it doesn't just matter what variables we declare
It also matters where we declare them
Scope determines where variables are "in play"

```
function declareBankruptcy() {
    let bankruptcy = true;
}
declareBankruptcy();
console.log(bankruptcy);
```
في هاد الكود رح يعطي ايرور لانو المتغير لسا مش معرف  declare

#### Scopes are nested within the program The widest scope is the global scope ,Each function gets its own new scope within the scope where it was declared

### Scope in JavaScript refers to where you can access variables. It determines the visibility and lifespan of variables within your code.
```
let planet = "Jupiter";
function scopeOut() {
    let planet = "Mars";
    console.log("Inner planet:", planet);
}
scopeOut();
console.log("Outer planet:", planet);
```
output:

### Inner planet: Mars
### Outer planet: Jupiter

***********************************8
Scope in programming refers to the area of code where a variable is accessible and can be used. In JavaScript, you can think of scope as a set of boundaries that determine where a variable can be seen and used.

## "Within each scope, you can access variables declared in a wider scope (e.g. global scope)":

This means that if you have a variable declared outside of a function (in the global scope), you can access that variable from within the function. For example:
```
let globalVariable = 42;

function myFunction() {
    console.log(globalVariable); // You can access globalVariable here
}

myFunction();

```
=====================
### But not those declared in a narrower scope (e.g. function scope)":
This means that variables declared inside a function are only accessible within that function (function scope). They are not visible or accessible from outside the function. For example:
```
function myFunction() {
    let localVariable = "I am local";
    console.log(localVariable); // You can access localVariable here
}

myFunction();

console.log(localVariable); // This will result in an error because localVariable is not accessible here

```


### Global Scope:
Variables declared outside any function or block have global scope. They can be accessed from anywhere in your code, including inside functions.

### Local Scope:
(Function Scope): Variables declared inside a function have local scope. They are only accessible within that function and are not visible from outside.

### Block Scope:
Variables declared with let and const inside blocks (like loops or conditionals) have block scope. They are limited to that specific block.

## let and scope
### Variables declared with let can be modified from within a narrower scope ,This can be useful, but also dangerous!

In JavaScript, let is a keyword used to declare variables with block-level scope. This means that a variable declared with let is only accessible within the block of code where it's defined.
```
let feeling = "free";
function trap() {
    feeling = "boxedIn";
}
trap();
console.log(feeling);
```
## output:  boxedIn
explain:
the variable feeling is modified within the trap() function, and this modified value is reflected when you log it using console.log after calling the function. The variable feeling is in the outer/global scope, so it can be accessed and modified from within the trap() function.
*****************************
The Temporal Dead Zone (TDZ) is a concept in JavaScript that refers to the period between the entering of scope and the actual declaration of a variable using let or const. During this phase, if you try to access the variable, you'll get a ReferenceError.

To understand this better, let's break it down step by step:

Declaration Phase: When JavaScript starts executing a scope (a block of code enclosed by curly braces), it scans through the code to find variable and function declarations. Variables declared with var are hoisted and initialized with undefined, and variables declared with let or const are hoisted but not initialized.

Temporal Dead Zone: Between the start of the scope and the actual declaration of a let or const variable, a "dead zone" exists. During this phase, any attempt to access the variable results in a ReferenceError.

Initialization: Once the code execution reaches the point of the actual declaration, the variable is formally created and assigned its value.

Here's an example to illustrate the Temporal Dead Zone:
```
console.log(a); // This will result in a ReferenceError

let a = 10; // Variable declaration and initialization

```
In this example, even though a is declared with let, accessing it before the declaration line will lead to a ReferenceError due to the Temporal Dead Zone. The variable a is within the scope, but it's not yet initialized.

# Events & Handlers
<img src="https://github.com/TamaraNoierat/Mastering-JavaScript-in-20-Days/assets/130704887/76ebce52-4d5f-45be-a2a3-f3132afd4d86">

Events in JavaScript are things that happen on a webpage, like clicking a button, moving the mouse, or submitting a form. They allow you to make your webpage interactive and responsive.
Listening for Events: You can tell your code to "listen" for specific events on certain elements. When the event occurs, your code can respond.


*******************
```
document.addEventListener("click", () => {
    console.log("clicked")
});
```
explian the ex: whenever you click anywhere on the web page, the "click" event will be detected, and the message "clicked" will be logged to the browser's console.

<img src="https://github.com/TamaraNoierat/Mastering-JavaScript-in-20-Days/assets/130704887/47ab250c-9607-4f3a-b9d9-80993f1a2e2c">

Event Handling: The code that runs when an event occurs is called the event handler. It's like a set of instructions for what to do when an event happens.
### Event Types: There are various types of events in JavaScript, including:

1-Mouse events (click, mouseover, mouseout, etc.)
2-Keyboard events (keydown, keyup, keypress)
3-Form events (submit, input, change)
4-Window events (resize, load, scroll)

### Event Listeners: You can attach event listeners to HTML elements to respond to specific events. Event listeners listen for the occurrence of an event and then execute a callback function when the event occurs.
```
const button = document.getElementById("myButton");

// Adding a click event listener
button.addEventListener("click", function() {
  console.log("Button clicked!");
});

```

### Event Objects: When an event occurs, it creates an object containing details about the event. This helps your code understand what happened.


```
const button = document.getElementById("clickme");
const paragraphs = document.querySelectorAll("p");

button.addEventListener("click", event => {
  for (let p of paragraphs) {
    p.classList.toggle("hidden");
  }
})
```
explain:The JavaScript code uses the classList.toggle() method to add or remove the "hidden" class, effectively showing or hiding the paragraphs based on their current visibility state.
### Removing Event Listeners: It's also possible to remove event listeners if they are no longer needed. This can be important to prevent memory leaks and unexpected behavior.
```
function clickHandler() {
  console.log("Button clicked!");
}

button.addEventListener("click", clickHandler);

// Removing the event listener
button.removeEventListener("click", clickHandler);

```
