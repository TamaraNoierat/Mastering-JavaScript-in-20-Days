# DEEP JS FOUNDATIONS
Postfix Operators:
Postfix operators are applied after the operand. The most common example in JavaScript is the increment (++) and decrement (--) operators. When used postfix, they increase or decrease the value of the operand after the value is evaluated.
ex:
```
let x = 5;
let y = x++; // y will be 5, x will be 6
```
Prefix Operators:
Prefix operators are applied before the operand. In JavaScript, the increment (++) and decrement (--) operators can also be used as prefix operators. When used as prefix, they increase or decrease the value of the operand before the value is evaluated.
ex:
```
let a = 10;
let b = ++a; // a will be 11, b will be 11

```

#### In JavaScript, not everything is an object. JavaScript has both primitive data types and objects.

Primitive data types include:

Number: Represents both integer and floating-point numbers.

String: Represents sequences of characters.

Boolean: Represents true or false values.

Undefined: Represents a variable that has been declared but hasn't been assigned a value.

Null: Represents the intentional absence of any value.

Symbol: Represents a unique and immutable value that can be used as an object property.


Objects in JavaScript are more complex data structures that can have properties and methods. They include:

Plain Objects: Created using object literals or the Object constructor.
Arrays: Special type of objects used to store ordered collections of data.
Functions: Objects that can be executed and have their own properties and methods.
Custom Objects: Objects created using constructor functions or classes.
Built-in Objects: Objects provided by the JavaScript environment, like Date, RegExp, Math, etc.
