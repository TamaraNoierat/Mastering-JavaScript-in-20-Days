# DEEP JS FOUNDATIONS
Postfix Operators:
Postfix operators are applied after the operand. The most common example in JavaScript is the increment (++) and decrement (--) operators. When used postfix, they increase or decrease the value of the operand after the value is evaluated.
ex:
```
let x = 5;
let y = x++; // y will be 5, x will be 6
```
Prefix Operators:
Prefix operators are applied before the operand. In JavaScript, the increment (++) and decrement (--) operators can also be used as prefix operators. When used as prefix, they increase or decrease the value of the operand before the value is evaluated.
ex:
```
let a = 10;
let b = ++a; // a will be 11, b will be 11

```
