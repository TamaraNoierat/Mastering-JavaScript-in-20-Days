# Conditions 
conditions help your code make decisions and repeat tasks. They're like following instructions and picking different paths based on what's happening, just like making choices in real life situations.

### Expression: An expression is something that produces a value. It can be a simple value, like a number or a string, or it can be a more complex calculation or operation.

# Boolean Logic Operators


## 1  AND Operator (&&):
  Imagine you have two conditions, like "Is it sunny?" and "Is it warm?"
The AND operator (&&) helps you check if both conditions are true.

## 2. OR Operator (||):
Imagine you have two conditions, like "Is it raining?" and "Is it a weekend?"
The OR operator (||) helps you check if at least one condition is true.

# Conditional (Ternary) Operator

### string backticks and ${}

using backticks and ${} (string interpolation) together in JavaScript allows you to create more readable, flexible, and expressive strings that incorporate dynamic values and expressions.

## filter calls a true/fals function on each item and create a new arry with only the item where the function return true

## Array Spread using Spread Operator (...):

The spread operator (...) can be used to create a new array by spreading the elements of an existing array. It provides an easy way to clone, concatenate, or manipulate arrays.

## while loop 
When to Use: Use a while loop when you want to repeat something an unknown number of times based on a condition. Just make sure the condition eventually becomes false.

Remember, a while loop keeps going while the condition is true!

************
Using while (true) in JavaScript creates a never-ending loop that can freeze your program or cause problems. It's usually a bad idea because your code won't stop running.

## Synchronous code
in JavaScript refers to code that is executed in a sequential and blocking manner. It means that each line of code is executed one after the other, and the next line of code doesn't start until the previous one finishes. This behavior is the default in JavaScript.

## Asynchronous Code in JavaScript:
In JavaScript, most code runs one after another, but sometimes we need to handle tasks that take time, like fetching data from a server or reading a file. Asynchronous code helps us deal with such tasks without blocking other code from running.

## JavaScript is often referred to as a "single-threaded" language
"single-threaded" in the context of JavaScript means that code is executed sequentially, one instruction at a time, within a single main thread of execution.
